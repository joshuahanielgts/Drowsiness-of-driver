# Drowsiness-of-driver
We propose a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using computer vision. Our Python implementation uses OpenCV for video capture and Dlib for facial landmark detection to monitor eye regions. By calculating the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), we classify driver states as active, drowsy, or sleeping, providing a low-cost real-time alert solution.
